    <h1>TypeScript Generics</h1>
    <h3>Check the console for the outputs of each exercises</h3>

    <h5>
        Exercise 1: Identity Function
        Write a generic function called identity that takes a single argument of any type and returns the same value.
        Ensure that the function is type-safe by using generics.
        You can choose to implement this function as a standalone function.
        <br><br>

        Exercise 2: Array Reversal
        Write a generic function called reverseArray that takes an array of any type and returns a new array with the elements reversed.
        Ensure that the function is type-safe by using generics.
        You can choose to implement this function as a standalone function.
        <br><br>

        Exercise 3: Pair
        Write a generic class called Pair that represents a pair of values of any type.
        The class should have two properties, first and second, each of which can hold a value of any type.
        Ensure that the class is type-safe by using generics.
        You can choose to implement this as a class.
        <br><br>

        Exercise 4: Queue
        Write a generic class called Queue that represents a queue data structure.
        The class should have methods enqueue to add an element to the queue, dequeue to remove and return the first element from the queue, and isEmpty to check if the queue is empty.
        Ensure that the class is type-safe by using generics.
        You can choose to implement this as a class.
        <br><br>

        Exercise 5: Key-Value Store
        Write a generic class called KeyValueStore that represents a simple key-value store.
        The class should have methods set to add a key-value pair to the store, get to retrieve the value associated with a given key, and remove to remove a key-value pair from the store.
        Ensure that the class is type-safe by using generics.
        You can choose to implement this as a class.
